Actionable Steps for Cost Optimization in GCP:

1.Analyze GCP Billing Reports:

Use the GCP Billing Dashboard to understand your spending patterns. Enable billing export to BigQuery for granular analysis.
Look at monthly trends, identify cost spikes, and check which services are consuming the most resources.

2.Leverage Committed Use Contracts (CUCs):

Evaluate your compute workloads to determine if committed use discounts make sense. You can save up to 57% by committing to usage over one or three years.

3. Rightsize Compute Resources:

Use the Google Cloud Recommender to automatically identify over-provisioned resources (e.g., VMs, memory, CPU, storage) and adjust them accordingly.

4. Use Preemptible VMs:

For non-critical workloads like batch processing or fault-tolerant applications, preemptible VMs can save you up to 80%.

5. Optimize Storage Costs:

Move infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes (Coldline or Archive) or use lifecycle management policies.
Delete or archive unused snapshots and backups.

6. Use Autoscaling and Serverless:

Take advantage of autoscaling for workloads with variable demand and explore serverless options (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) to avoid over-provisioning.

7. Monitor and Set Budgets/Alerts:

Set up billing alerts to notify you when you exceed thresholds. Also, use quotas to prevent unintentional cost overages.

8. Optimize Networking Costs:

Review egress traffic to reduce cross-region networking charges by placing resources in the same region.
Use Cloud CDN for content delivery optimization.

9. Review Third-Party Services:

Evaluate the use of third-party services and ensure they are necessary, as some integrations can add to your GCP bill unnecessarily.

10. Use BigQuery Reservations:

For large data processing tasks in BigQuery, consider purchasing BigQuery flat-rate pricing and assign capacity based on demand.
