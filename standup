1. Today I worked on cost optimisation where I started analyzing the billing patterns for resources in GCP for last 90 days
-Based on my findings there are certain resources where I need to investigate the behaviour of applications running in UAT environment.

2. Today I went to confluence and started creating notes on our existing infrastructure.
-Based on those notes I can suggest some strategies to improve our infrastructure.

Meeting Notes:

1. So far I am working bucket object deletion. One of the bucket objects has been deleted and second bucket process has been initialed.
2. On cost optimization task. Last week I have analyzed the compute engines workloads for anomalies and any changes.
Same I did for composer based clusters where multiple nodes are bearing the workloads. Now to get more in depth knowledge on this. 
I have tried scheduling a meeting with Liang but he's on vacation. So now for this week I am going to have meeting with Satish and Linlin on the same matter.
Once I will get a better understandin of workloads in the UAT environment then I can create a report on cost optimization strategies what we can implement.
3. Apart from this Last week I had few meeting with Yihan to resolve the session timeout error. 
So far the load test looks fine the session timeout error occurance has been significantly reduced. But still satish and team are still performing some load tests to be sure.
